This program is designed to convert a molecular formula string of two types (1) simple or (2) protein into a usable
object on which calculations can be performed.

The following conventions must be followed when using the SimpleMolecularFormula class:
    - No parentheses are allowed (e.g. Na2(SO4)) is not valid
    - All elements are case sensitive (e.g. nacl is not valid but NaCl is valid)
    - If only one of an element is present, a number is not necessary (e.g. H2O1 and H2O are both valid)
The following conventions must be followed when using the ProteinMolecularFormula class:
    - All amino acids must be separated by dashes (e.g. Phe-Ala is valid but PheAla is not)
    - Either three-letter or one-letter abbreviations can be used (e.g. Gly and G are both valid)
    - Three- and one-letter abbreviations are both case sensitive (e.g. gly-gly or g-g are not valid)

After starting the program, a GUI interface will pop up. The upper left-hand corner is for data input. In the text box,
the molecular formula can be entered using the conventions listed above. After entering the molecular formula, the radio
button for either protein or simple molecular formula must be selected. NOTE: if the incorrect button is selected,
the program will not parse the molecular formula.

Next, the "Generate Data" button can be pressed. One pressed, the box on the right (labeled "Chemical Information") will
display the molecular weight of the molecule along with the uncertainty of the calculation. Calculations are based on
data from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The graph displayed below shows a simulated
mass spectrum of the given molecular formula. This simulated mass spectrum is based on isotopic abundance data from
IUPAC. The legend shows the molecular formula with elements separated by brackets.

NOTE: The legend for the simulated mass spectrum can sometimes show unexpected results. To fix this, simply press the
generate data button again.
